I need to create the README.md documentation for the project. It must include:

1. Clear execution instructions with examples
2. Explanation of the approach and tradeoffs made
3. Justification of the chosen performance metric
4. Specific tie-break rule
5. System assumptions
6. List of future improvements if I had more time
7. AI usage indication
8. Time invested
9. Project structure
10. Output example

The README should be in English and follow the format specified in Rules.txt. I also need to create the AI prompts files used and a FIXES.md with the corrections made.
